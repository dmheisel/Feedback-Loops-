### FEEDBACK LOOPS

This is a simple app for managing daily feedback for a classroom or workshop.

Input a value each step along the way.  Users rate their current feelings, their current level of understanding, and their feeling of support from staff.

Once a value is entered, a user can go back to that page using the drawer menu along the left.  Values will be saved and updated when a user hits "next page".  Once all fields are filled in, the user will get a final Review page to display their inputs prior to submission.

Users can add additional comments for staff, but these are not required for feedback to be accepted.

Administrators can view the admin page, with a list of all feedback submitted.  From there, they can flag a specific feedback for further review, or delete them from the list if they are no longer needed.
